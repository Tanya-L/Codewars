For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date
resultant table schema
id
name
NOTE: sometimes a department will not not contain a sale over $98 so just resubmit.

************
SELECT id, name
FROM departments
WHERE id IN (SELECT department_id FROM sales 
                WHERE (price) > 98.00);
