For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an EXISTS to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date
resultant table schema
id
name
NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

***************
SELECT id, name
FROM departments
WHERE EXISTS
  (SELECT * FROM departments
  INNER JOIN sales
  ON departments.id=sales.department_id
  WHERE price > 98.00);
