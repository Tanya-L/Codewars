SQL Basics: Simple JOIN and RANK

For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, and join to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count.

people table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
people_id
sale
price
You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale_count" and the rank as "sale_rank".

NOTE: You're solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
**********************************************
SELECT p.id, p.name, 
  COUNT(s.sale) AS sale_count, 
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.id ORDER BY p.id DESC) AS sale_rank 
FROM people p
  INNER JOIN sales s
  ON p.id = s.people_id
  GROUP BY p.id;
